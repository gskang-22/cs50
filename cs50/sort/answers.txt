sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: sort1 takes a longer time to sort random10000.txt than sorted10000.txt, which means its big O is greater than its omega Ω, and thus uses bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 takes the shortest time to sort the .txt file, and thus uses merge sort which has the smallest order of O(n log n).

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Time taken to sort random10000.txt and sorted10000.txt are roughly similar, which means sort3 uses selection sort which has the same big O and omega Ω.
